        <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>

        <p class="red italics" id="dom">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programming languages to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages. <span class="wordLength">Words: </span></p>

        <h2>Why is the DOM important?</h2>
        <p class="blue italics" id="importance">The DOM is important because it allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. By manipulating the DOM, developers can change the content and style of a web page in response to user actions, such as clicks or keyboard input. <span class="wordLength">Words: </span></p>

        <p class="italics">Also, the DOM is a platform- and language-neutral interface that can be used with any programming language that can manipulate objects. This makes it a powerful tool for web development. <span class="wordLength">Words: </span></p>
